### My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this exercise I improved my understanding of @media.I used the pseudo class :hover also adding cursor pointer and removing the possibility that the user can select the text of the button by mistake.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on Media Queries, I understand the basics but, I want to create better responsive layouts. I think I need to study Bootstrap to improve CSS code reading, the class names I use are not always comprehensive at first glance.
